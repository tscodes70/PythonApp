1,2017-11-06T20:51:11Z,NA,Two East 55th Street at Fifth Avenue,Hotel,NA,New York,US,NA,NA,NA,The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,NA,NA,0.0,NA,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur.

The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay.

We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted.

The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY.

At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well.

There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

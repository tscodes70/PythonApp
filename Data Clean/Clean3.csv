The first room we were shown had a funny smell. The room we took was quite large and pretty clean, although there was a couch in there that was horribly stained and I really didn't want to know what went on on it. The sheets were clean but didn't quite fit and were not neatly tucked. Considering the size of the room, it was surprising that there was no closet. The bathroom was pretty clean, but the tub could have used a more thorough scrubbing along the bottom and the toilet lid looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in years (but at least the toilet itself was clean). The towels were clean but old and worn (and I wondered whether they could spare more than the 2 they left).    Now, for the good part. The first clue that this place was not for me was the bullet-proof glass covering the front desk and the fact that they wanted to copy my driver's license. Once the motorcycle gangs passed outside, we finally fell asleep only to awaken in the middle of the night by aggressive yelling by a man in the next room followed by the screams of a woman.

Most hotels in Hollywood have parking but you have to pay and its not on the premises.

The room was very large and the internet (free) was fast. Room was very dim yet it had so many light switches scattered in the large room. The counters were very low and I had to keep going on my knees to look in the mirrors (Im 58 which is not that tall). My window had a lovely view of a wall a few inches from the building. The bathroom seemed new and clean but the water temperature was not stable. The TV reception was bad and NBC was completely out during the Olympics! Staff didnt have a solution for it. Luckily I had my DVR at home running or else I would have demanded my money back. Around 10:30pm a lady was banging at a door demanding her things from someone who refused to open the door. Staff tried to calm her down but she kept hitting the door and shouting crude things. By the looks of her she was a hooker. Staff called security/police to get her out but it took a long time before they were called. Staff also sunk to the womans level by saying profanities which was very unprofessional. The room was very dark which was nice when trying to sleep. In the morning, the parking situation was horrible. People parked in places that were not spots and they blocked me, my boyfriend and others from moving their cars. My boyfriend and I are locals and we had to go to work that morning. Staff was too busy addressing complaining guests to help out with getting our cars out. After 15 mins of careful maneuvering I got my car out and had to lend my car to my boyfriend so he could get to work on time after dropping me off.

The staff, however, were really friendly and helpful and were always giving us directions. They even helped us figure out how to get to Anaheim.

The fortified main office where the clerk can barely stick his hand out to give you the room keys and you can barely hear him through what appears to be bullet proof glass.

It is still, just your average basic motel. It is clean, at least, from the two times that I've stayed here. Decent for a couple of nights.    Couple of things I want to point out:  1. Customer service is pretty good. Didn't have any issues with check in or check-out.    2. The room and bathroom were pretty much clean but, they do have this odor to them (smells like cigarettes even though it's a non-smoking room).    3. Rooms, although spacious and big, is very dark (same with the bathroom).    4. Parking is in the back (easily missed if you're driving on Sunset) so slowdown as it is a one-way driveway to get to the back parking lot (the pathway is to the left of the inn). The lot is small though. If you actually are in a spot, and have to leave early the next day, be prepared to be blocked in. I once had to leave early (around 4:30am) and I had to play tetris and move two cars around to unblock my car to be able to leave (FrontDesk personnel did not know how to drive so I had to do it myself, which I didn't mind). He was around to help guide me move the cars. Fortunately, I didn't park too far in into the lot (otherwise, it would have been tricky trying to get all those cars out to get my car out of the lot).    5. Check out Leo's Taco Truck, literally within feet of the hotel, in the parking lot at Western/Sunset. Oh, there's always a Walgreens next door, Food 4 Less across the street, McDonalds, and a bunch of eateries nearby and within walking distance.    6. Wifi is free and I didn't have any issues with it.",Not bad given the price and location...,bad location price . average basic motel . clean times stayed . Decent couple nights . Couple .

This was my least favorite option out of the four just due to the parking situation I've read about in other reviews. We got a king size bed room which was fairly large and spacious. The room was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower head was one of the strongest jet streams I've ever felt. The front desk staff was nice too. It is a good location walking distance to grocery, Starbucks, Thai food, smoothies and Walgreens right next door. When we arrived around 3:00pm our room was ready and parking was available. The driveway to go back to is very narrow - a Jeep Trailblazer was able to fit down it though. There are 9 spots and Sunday morning when we went to checkout our car was blocked in, see image. However the front desk immediately contacted the guests and their cars were moved, so I give them props for that. A few suggestions for the king size bed room: Put the TV on the wall in front of the bed that is closer - it's was rather far away on the back wall. Add a tissue box to the room. Place a full length mirror in the room and add lighting by the half mirror. Soap bars could be a little bigger. Other than that, the room for one night worked for our needs. Also a plus that a fridge was in the room!",Good Location & Cheap,hotel Hotwire blind notified hotel options book . favorite option parking situation read reviews . king size bed spacious . clean bed comfy shower head strongest jet streams . desk staff nice . location walking distance grocery Starbucks Thai food smoothies Walgreens door . arrived 300pm ready parking . driveway narrow Jeep Trailblazer fit . spots Sunday morning checkout car blocked image . desk contacted guests cars moved props . suggestions king size bed wall bed closer wall .

I was pleasantly surprised. I was worried by some of the reviews but didn't need to be.  We arrived and were checked in quickly and easily with no problems. We were given wifi codes on arrival and directed to our room. It was room 214 on the 2nd floor at the end of the corridor. It was a smoking room which was all they had when I booked. I was worried it was gonna smell of smoke but it smelt clean and fresh. The room itself was of a decent size, with a large king size bed and an adequate bathroom.There were bed side tables and lamps on each side of the bed, a dressing table with mirror and chair, a dresser with 2 drawers, a small place to hang your clothes and a fridge in the room. There was also a heater/aircon.didn't need to use it so can't comment on it. Also there was a hair dryer which I didn't use.  Everything wirked as it should. The wifi was fast- I'm using it to write this review! There was plenty of hot water for showering and never ran out Water pressure was good and I enjoyed the showers. Soap and shampoo provided.Bathrown clean. The bath was tiny though! Fine as I didn't want a bath. There were some cigarette burns sounds the sink but never bothered me as it didn't impact the usage of the sink. Plenty of towels provided although they are very small!  The bed very comfortable. My partner and I slept well every night. The sheets were changed and were clean. The top blanket had a few small cigarette burns but again no concern to me. 3 comfortable pillows provided.  The fridge made occasional humming sounds in the night but this was ok. Didn't wake us and kept everything cold. Staff friendly although we had limited contact with them as all was fine.  Location excellent - 5 min walk from Hollywood/Western which links you to Hollywood Boulevard in 2 stops for Chinese theater, walk of fame etc. Also nearby, food 4 less across the road, wall greens next door, subway, McDonald's, 7/11 etc. There's also a taco truck outside.  Parking seemed adequate, we didn't use it though. There was about 9 slaves and when we got back at around 9pm there was always 1 or 2 spaces left although packed in the morning!  I highly recomend this hotel. It was fit for purpose and I would defiantly stay here again.

22,Hotel Zelos,CA,US,2016-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in!

After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel.",0.8953
24,Hotel Zelos,CA,US,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!",0.9852

28,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,MD,US,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!",0.9939

Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.",0.6652

Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant.

Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.",0.8002
37,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,MD,US,2011-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..,0.942

It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast.

109,The Boxer,MA,US,2016-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been.

I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests.

As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.",0.9953

On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway.

Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money.

The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel.

The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay.

We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus.

320,The Charlesmark Hotel,MA,US,2016-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street!

The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel.

When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.",0.9971

The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.",0.9969

There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel.

381,Hotel Renew,HI,US,2007-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",0.9972

This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)",0.9538

The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.",0.9789
385,Hotel Renew,HI,US,2007-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.",0.9923
386,Hotel Renew,HI,US,2006-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!",0.9981

Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!",0.9975
390,Hotel Renew,HI,US,2007-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!",0.9993

It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well!

We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice.

Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks.

I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference.

The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis.

Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last!

Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",0.9947

717,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2016-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay.

727,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2017-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur.

The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York.

It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location.

733,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",0.9975

736,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2016-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor.

737,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2017-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York.

Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top.

741,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

743,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor.

746,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2016-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel.

750,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2015-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

754,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning!

758,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you.

We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

761,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",0.9922

The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee.

The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY.

765,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2015-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

766,The St. Regis New York,NY,US,2017-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",0.9757

I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.",0.9916

878,Kinzie Hotel,IL,US,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.",0.9956

I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess.

920,Kinzie Hotel,IL,US,2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.",0.9822

Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2.

975,Moxy Chicago Downtown,IL,US,2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service.

The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice.

1005,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,CA,US,2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming.",0.9503
1006,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,CA,US,2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great.",0.9958

1013,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,CA,US,2017-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room.

That was very dissapointing because I was with teenagers that could not be in the bar area and needed something to do. I thought it was wrong to advertise a game room that is continously not available because of private party's. And I stayed on a Thursday I'm sure it's worse on the weekends.

1041,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,CA,US,2016-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy",-0.1608

You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed.

I‚Äôm not one to complain at all about hotels and after checking out the hotels reviews I thought a nice cheap room that is clean will be great to finish off our stay as we didn‚Äôt need anything flash. We checked in on our first night and just before heading to bed we found cockroaches running around in our room. Because it was so late we decided to stay the night and speak to management in the morning. However I woke up in the morning covered in some form of a rash all over my body. So we packed everything up and checked out. Reception didn‚Äôt care one little bit about the room having cockroaches and all his response was ‚Äúok‚Äù. Told us to go back to who we made the booking with to get a refund for the two nights we didn‚Äôt stay in the hotel, we did this and after Qantas got in touch with the hotel they declined to give a refund.

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Apr 2019,20,A classic cheap hotel!,"I must admit I booked this on a third party website without prior knowledge of what hotel I would get. I wanted something cheap (under $90) since we were only going to sleep a few hours after a long drive and then head out again.    Before arriving here I had only seen this type of hotel in movies. You know, the ones where the main character is down and out on his luck and can barely afford a roof over his head. The fortified main office where the clerk can barely stick his hand out to give you the room keys and you can barely hear him through what appears to be bullet proof glass. A guy on the rear balcony smoking a joint. In fact my wife said there was a heavy marihuana smell throughout the hotel. How did she notice it and I didn‚Äôt, hmmm?    That quaint atmosphere aside I must say rooms where clean and spacious. WiFi and parking (although very limited) are free, and you‚Äôre on Sunset Blvd - the gritty side. But we got a smoking room which for us is a definite NO since my kids are highly allergic and my daughter has asthma.    Luckily we arrived almost at midnight and checked out early to go see the sights of LA, on the west side of Sunset Blvd.    If you need something for one night and are on a tight budget then go for it. If you can pay slightly over $175 then check into Hollywood Inn Express.

We ended up getting car troubles and couldn‚Äôt make it there for check in time but they understood and didn‚Äôt penalize us in anyway which was great. They do have their own parking lot around back with about 8 spots & 1 handicapped space, when you check in you need to provide your drivers license number and plates so they know you are staying there & dont tow your vehicle. We stayed in the 1 king bed smoking room since we wanted to enjoy legal Cannabis, the room is spacious and very minimal furniture which I would expect in a smoking room. The room was very clean and had fresh sheets and toiletries, the bathroom is nice and we had a window that could fully open to enjoy the breeze. The a/c works very well in the room and you can regulate it yourself and you do get free WiFi which works pretty good. This hotel is in a very good location. There is a Walgreens to the right of the hotel and a small discrete dispensary about 500 feet to the left. Across the street is a supermarket and a McDonald‚Äôs and about 5 minutes walking distance is a bunch of food places, taco trucks, frozen yogurt shops, a shopping center and a Starbucks with WiFi. You are literally walking distance to Hollywood blvd. and can see the Hollywood sign pretty good, we decided to use the limes scooters we were seeing everywhere which made getting around and exploring way more fun and was actually pretty cheap. It‚Äôs $1 to unlock and .15¬¢ per minute. It never costed us more than $4 per ride and was really fun. This hotel is a great spot for someone who just wants the California experience without the California price tag. Very minimalistic, basic, and straightforward what you see is what you get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or60-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jan 2019,10,Terrible place...,"We booked this motel (not a hotel!) via Hotwire (blind booking). I feel very disappointed. The place itself very old in every inch on site. The staff trying to put some life into this place, but no luck so far. Everything just very old. Very cold. I guess this motel will be good for the summer trip, not for winter definitely. The HVAC in the room working as it wants. You can try to regulate all settings for this old machine as long as you want but it will be working in own way and will create a lot of noise!!! Towels are so small and very thin. The smell in the room is terrible (oldness and dampness). We got a non-smoking room but felt smoke every night. Also, the smell of Indian spices is everywhere. To be honest, this place is clean and the staff do their job properly every single day. The location is ok but honestly, to take a tour around Hollywood you need (maybe) no longer than 3-4 hours. You don't need to book a hotel there. The system of public transportation is very good. This is a good idea to book the good hotel in downtown Los Angeles and take Metro to Hollywood, Universal City or beautiful beaches in Santa Monica, Long Beach or Venice. It will cost you a bit more but you will have comfort necessary for a good rest after a long day travel around. The truth is all motels (no hotels! they are all motels) in the Hollywood area are pretty much the same (some of them better some worst). One more time I learn from my own experience: the cheap place to stay could turn your vacation to a nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or60-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

This was my least favorite option out of the four just due to the parking situation I've read about in other reviews. We got a king size bed room which was fairly large and spacious. The room was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower head was one of the strongest jet streams I've ever felt. The front desk staff was nice too. It is a good location walking distance to grocery, Starbucks, Thai food, smoothies and Walgreens right next door. When we arrived around 3:00pm our room was ready and parking was available. The driveway to go back to is very narrow - a Jeep Trailblazer was able to fit down it though. There are 9 spots and Sunday morning when we went to checkout our car was blocked in, see image. However the front desk immediately contacted the guests and their cars were moved, so I give them props for that. A few suggestions for the king size bed room: Put the TV on the wall in front of the bed that is closer - it's was rather far away on the back wall. Add a tissue box to the room. Place a full length mirror in the room and add lighting by the half mirror. Soap bars could be a little bigger. Other than that, the room for one night worked for our needs.

It is still, just your average basic motel. It is clean, at least, from the two times that I've stayed here. Decent for a couple of nights.    Couple of things I want to point out:  1. Customer service is pretty good. Didn't have any issues with check in or check-out.    2. The room and bathroom were pretty much clean but, they do have this odor to them (smells like cigarettes even though it's a non-smoking room).    3. Rooms, although spacious and big, is very dark (same with the bathroom).    4. Parking is in the back (easily missed if you're driving on Sunset) so slowdown as it is a one-way driveway to get to the back parking lot (the pathway is to the left of the inn). The lot is small though. If you actually are in a spot, and have to leave early the next day, be prepared to be blocked in. I once had to leave early (around 4:30am) and I had to play tetris and move two cars around to unblock my car to be able to leave (FrontDesk personnel did not know how to drive so I had to do it myself, which I didn't mind). He was around to help guide me move the cars. Fortunately, I didn't park too far in into the lot (otherwise, it would have been tricky trying to get all those cars out to get my car out of the lot).    5. Check out Leo's Taco Truck, literally within feet of the hotel, in the parking lot at Western/Sunset. Oh, there's always a Walgreens next door, Food 4 Less across the street, McDonalds, and a bunch of eateries nearby and within walking distance.    6. Wifi is free and I didn't have any issues with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or60-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

First, parking is a joke. You get ""free"" parking if you are there early enough to get a space. Secondly, you need to pray there is no one leaving or blocking the only way in or out of the parking lot. The driveway is barley wide enough to accommodate a full size pick up truck. Then they want to give me the option of being the one who will have to be called to move their vehicle at night if someone needs to get in, like i choose the exit aisle on the plane or something. smh So i ask to look at my room before i check in. I turn right around and head right out the door. PLEASE DONT BELIEVE THE PHOTOS!! This is every bit a one star location generously. The neighborhood is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY AT ALL!!!

The walls are paper thin. 2 nights(Tuesday and Wednesday), that was fine as it was reasonably quiet. However, 2 nights (Sunday and Monday) were miserable because of people being extremely loud in the hallway and in surrounding rooms and someone smoking in the alley and the smoke coming through the AC into the room. The free parking was very much appreciated, but tricky to navigate.

I don't like to cause a fuss and had no where else to stay but this was a major put off from the start.    The other problem is the security of the place, no safe in the room. Front and rear door open all night so anybody can walk through the hotel at any time (we got the gist it was quite a rough neighbourhood with a lot of homeless people sleep around nearby).

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jan 2016,20,Not good,"Probably one of the worst hotels I stayed in. It is not actually a hotel, it is supposed to be a motel but it felt like a hostel.    PROS: good location, 3 blocks away from the metro station, in front there is a McDonalds, next to Walgreens, Starbucks, near a CVS Pharmacy. Around an hour (walking) away from the Walk of Fame. Reasonable price. Spacious bedroom. Clean bathroom.    CON: oh boy. 1) the front desk. They have a separate window glass so there is a barrier when you try to show them/talk to them. Not a personalized attention. 2) the first night we had to call them because our TV wasn't working. The receptionist couldn't helped us, so his advice was ""please keep trying until it works"" (???). Then it turned out, the heating wasn't working. Again I had to call them (never in my life I had to bother the front desk twice in a row). At least THAT he could fix. 3) the smell. In the hallways it was like we got into an Indian restaurant; the smell was so strong, and what it is weird, they do not even have a restaurant in the hotel. Inside the room, the smell was different, something similar to cigarettes, and even nastier, if possible. 4) Our 2nd day there, when we came back, our bed wasn't done and all our trash cans were still full of papers. Turns out, you have to put the message of ""clean please"" outside your door if you want the maids to clean your room. 5) when we wanted to book a shuttle, this hotel was not on the list. We had to chose a hotel that was 2 blocks from there so the shuttle could pick up us from there. Not exactly a ""con"", but just in case you want to avoid any hassles.    I was going to add that there are a lot of homeless people around there, but truth is, homeless people are everywhere in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or100-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Oct 2015,10,!DO NOT STAY HERE!,"Where do I begin!? Pulling up I missed the turn due to it being as wide as a vehicle! As I came back around and pulled in, luckily, no car was pulling out as it is a One way in, One way out. I get to the back of the building to see a parking lot fit for your house. If a spot wasn't open when I pulled up, I wouldn't know where to park. I check in - no problem. My Girlfriend and I get ready for the night and head to Universal Studios for Horror Night. We return at about 315am to find the parking lot ABSOULTELY FULL, with 2 cars NOT parked in spaces and blocking in 4 cars! So I finally manage to do a 360 with the little space that was given & back to Sunset Blvd I go to look for parking who knows where.. I drive next door to Walgreens to ask if I may park there due to My hotels lack of parking. No luck. I proceed to ask Food4Less directly across the street because they have a security guard & a gate around the lot. I found luck there but was asked to return at 9am to move it. As I am walking into the hotel I see the front desk attendent so i raise concern. I ask him why I wasn't informed about this LIMITED PARKING in the back, he didnt know what to say but ""you can park back there, leave your keys with me & I will move it if its a problem."" I told him, ""I didnt even give you permission to drive my car, do you really think someone would leave a $60,000 set of keys with you?"" He was speechless & had no resolution for where I should park.. When i woke up at 9, no spaces in the back of my hotel became available so i had to ask for more time at Food4Less, lucky once again - till 12pm. As I am walking back into my hotel I come across the woman owner! I raised concern - this lady wanted to compare me driving around looking for a parking space to her driving around LAX looking for a spot and her looking for a spot in a restaurant parking lot. She had no concern for me parking my vehicle across the street NOT on hotel premises where I should have been parked since they ask for your license plate # & your make & model. She told me it wasn't her problem that I didnt inform them that I would be arriving IN A VEHICLE! Telling me, ""I don't know if you come on bus, walk, drive, taxi, I don't know."" I said that shouldn't matter you should have enough parking for all rooms, how many rooms are here?"" She says ""25."" There is about 8-10 spaces to park in. This hotel is so unfit for its guests I recommend YOU DO NOT STAY HERE!!!  Also a problem throughout my stay was the noise in the building, doors slamming, people running up & down the hall. People yelling at one another, random noises throughout the night & NO ICE MACHINE!!! The fridge in the room didnt keep my beer cold & the bathroom fan didnt work as it started to smell like smoke, I am assuming from the above room.. the TV was in an awkward place, the bed spread had cigarette burns in it as I am in a SMOKE FREE room..  People DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or100-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Oct 2015,50,Comfort at areasonable price.,"We, my 2 daughters, wife and I stayed for a total of 10 nights through September. It's not flash, just clean, very comfortable, large room, good bed for a good night's sleep and everything works. The family that run the hotel are very helpful and pleasant too. We had a total of 10 nights in LA and ended up staying here all 10 nights.  The location is very convenient: Metro station (Hollywood/Western) 5-10 minutes walk, bus stops just out front on Sunset Blvd to head west to Beverly Hills or east to downtown and also to head down Western to Koreatown. There's a Food for Less just across the road for groceries, plenty of Thai restaurants nearby and also all the popular names like Subway, Starbucks, McDonalds and 7-11 are close.  After a full day out we found it like a home away from to home to come back to our room.  The carpark is tight but Ash, the manager, has it worked out with fitting everyone's car in and letting people out.

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Sept 2015,30,Not bad,"I stayed there last week. The room was huge, the bed was clean. The carpet? What i learnt is that you shouldn't walk barefoot on your bedroom carpet because you'll realize soon enough that it is truely disgusting, the sole of my feet were black and the carpet was stained everywhere. The bed sheet had cigarette holes all over it. During the day the area was alright, but walking around at night was pretty scary. There were a lot of homeless people, they were totally fine, but im talking about the people hanging out on the parking lot near of the hotel at night.. thankfully there is a Walgreen in between that is open all night. Anyone can enter the hotel at any time of day and night, it is absolutely not secure. I had the habit to put the nightstand in front of the door during the night because i didn't feel safe. On my last night there, at about 4am i heard a loud bang on my door. I opened the lights and saw that the lock on the door had felt on the floor. I have not seen who was there and banged on the door but anyway, i couldn't get back to sleep after that.  The housekeeper wasn't friendly but the staff at the reception was great and helpful.  I chose this hotel for its proximity with the Sunset Strip, as i knew i was going to hang out there most evening. For my next trip i would go back if i don't find anything else, but i'll definitely try to find a hotel in West Hollywood/Westwood as i feel a whole lot safer there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or110-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

We literally wanted somewhere clean, safe with parking that was cheap and close to everything and that is exactly what we got. I cannot understand the bad reviews for this hotel?! The room was massive, parking was fine and although not in a upmarket area the location was safe. You will get homeless in every city you go to however they don't bother you at all.  We borrowed a iron from the owner which was no trouble and although the room had no safe we left quite a lot of money in there and all was fine.  The beds where huge and comfortable. The shower hot and everything was fine.

My bed (holes in bed spread) and bathroom was clean during my stay, but can't say the rest of everything else in the room. The metro is super close to walk to, Walgreens right next door, an awesome food truck that was parked outside. I was barely in the room, thankfully but I had a good nights sleep. No rowdy people luckily!

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jul 2015,10,DON'T!!,"I booked this motel after reading great trip advisor reviews, so I was extremely disappointed to discover they were all a load of crap.  To start with there is no security on the building. Guests can check in 24hours a day and enter through an unsecured door - back or front of the building. This means ANYONE can waltz through the main walkway at any time of day or night. I felt extremely unsafe.  The desk is unmanned and you push a bell for staff to come our from a little room out the back.  We stayed in the room directly opposite check in for five nights and we got very little sleep the whole time. A tour group of very loud people rocked up at 11pm to check in one night and there was no concern for any of the guests who may have been sleeping. The next night, same thing at 10.30pm. I don't know maybe this is an LA thing..  Disappointing as our days were packed with sightseeing and theme parks.  Thin walls so you can hear absolutely everything from people going up and down the stairs, to screaming at each other down the hall andguests who think it's fine to play loud music and indulge in loud conversation until 4am in a small motel - mind you there was Zero courtesy from staff to put a stop to it even when we asked a number of times.  We booked a smoking room as it was all that was left, and it was fine, but honestly.... Cigarette burn stains on bathroom vanity?? Burn holes in the bed linen?? Come on. Lift your game!! There was dirty carpets and a toilet whose flush abilities were very unreliable.  We have been overseas staying in hotels/motels for nearly six months. This is the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in my life. I couldn't even apologise for saying I wouldn't even recommend it to my enemy. If I had booked through the hotel website instead of a third party website, I would be asking for every single cent back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or110-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

The room booked was a non smoking double sized room with two comfortable double beds. The room was great as a base, clean and complete with fridge, air con and a TV (with some decent stations like HBO, AMC and the usual networks). The wifi was great to begin with (they give you the password on checking in), but they changed provider during our stay, and was good but unfortunately wasn't as reliable as earlier.    Had minimal contact with staff, but any requests were dealt with promptly and with a minimal of fuss.    No meals, but there is complimentary coffee/tea from the check in desk area.    The location on W Sunset Blvd is great. The Hollywood Western Metro station is only a couple of blocks away, so great for getting around (only a couple of stops from Hollywood Blvd and Universal Studios). A Food4Less is across the road, ideal for stocking up the fridge. A pharmacy is also next door. There are plenty eateries along the road, from McDonalds, to a couple of Denny's and other diners. Enough to eat out differently each day of the week. And go far enough along Sunset Blvd and there is the chance to shop your socks off, with stores like Amoeba Music, Meltdown Comics, Staples, Home Depot and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or110-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

We were given wifi codes on arrival and directed to our room. It was room 214 on the 2nd floor at the end of the corridor. It was a smoking room which was all they had when I booked. I was worried it was gonna smell of smoke but it smelt clean and fresh. The room itself was of a decent size, with a large king size bed and an adequate bathroom.There were bed side tables and lamps on each side of the bed, a dressing table with mirror and chair, a dresser with 2 drawers, a small place to hang your clothes and a fridge in the room. There was also a heater/aircon.didn't need to use it so can't comment on it. Also there was a hair dryer which I didn't use.  Everything wirked as it should. The wifi was fast- I'm using it to write this review! There was plenty of hot water for showering and never ran out Water pressure was good and I enjoyed the showers. Soap and shampoo provided.Bathrown clean. The bath was tiny though! Fine as I didn't want a bath. There were some cigarette burns sounds the sink but never bothered me as it didn't impact the usage of the sink. Plenty of towels provided although they are very small!  The bed very comfortable. My partner and I slept well every night. The sheets were changed and were clean. The top blanket had a few small cigarette burns but again no concern to me. 3 comfortable pillows provided.  The fridge made occasional humming sounds in the night but this was ok. Didn't wake us and kept everything cold. Staff friendly although we had limited contact with them as all was fine.  Location excellent - 5 min walk from Hollywood/Western which links you to Hollywood Boulevard in 2 stops for Chinese theater, walk of fame etc. Also nearby, food 4 less across the road, wall greens next door, subway, McDonald's, 7/11 etc. There's also a taco truck outside.  Parking seemed adequate, we didn't use it though. There was about 9 slaves and when we got back at around 9pm there was always 1 or 2 spaces left although packed in the morning!  I highly recomend this hotel. It was fit for purpose and I would defiantly stay here again.

We asked where to catch a bus from, which turned out to be just down the road, but they had no clue. Also, we tried to use the phone in the room, which you have to put a $5 deposit for, but it wouldn't work. The number we were dialling was definitely in use as they were able to ring it from reception, however the response was, you can't ring from here go back to your room and keep dialling until it works. But there was something clearly wrong with the phone, so we had to ring from a uk mobile instead which was really expensive! Rooms are pretty standard but nothing to shout about. However, if you don't have a car do not stay here. It is not in a nice area at all, around a 50 minute walk from the Chinese theatre, and the security of the motel is not good. Door left wide open in the middle of the night, giving anyone access to all of the motel room doors. Walls are very thin so you can hear everything from upstairs and next door, and lots of people shouting all through the night!

Management is always friendly and not fussy about early checkins, if rooms are available. And even though we were left with no choice but a smoking room for our first night in LA on a busy Halloween weekend, there was not a trace of foul smell in the room. We actually stayed in the room although they offered to change us the next morning. For the price and free parking ( our old hotel charges $15 per night which quickly adds up on our two week stays ) many quick food options within walking distance and a drug store on the corner you really cannot beat the value. Again, because it is so economical, you might find guests with loud children or less than mannered guests who scream and laugh outside your door, but that is not often and easily forgiven for the extra money we take shopping.

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jun 2014,20,Sort of seedy,"Booked for. 3 nights. The housekeeper and one of the front desk people were very nice. The room was very large. This place is in a very seedy neighborhood. Sirens all night. I never spend a lot of time so dont care about the decor. However this room was pretty bad. The walls had stains, the curtains had stains and were ripped. No screens on the window. The worst was the bathroom. Although the housekeeper did her best there were cigarette burns all over the sick and toilet. The bottwn of the tub was, well I wont even go there I would give this place one star but the housekeeper was so nice I gave two. The hall ways were clean and nice. There is about 24-26 rooms and 9 parking spots. Just so you know. The guy at the desk said most of the guests who stay there dont have cars so more spots arent needed. I pulled in and took the bus so i wont lose rhe spot. In the morning all spot were taken. What happens if he gets a lot of people with cars? This is a questionable hotel. Im not being mean just honest. Ive been in old places and didnt complain but there are limits. Dont take children here. Maybe it was just my room",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or130-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

I wasn't used to the city sounds, however, that is all over Hollywood and when we closed our windows it cut most of it out. The staff was very friendly and the maids were protective of our belongings when cleaning the room, which was nice. We only had to walk a couple of minutes from our room and we were already at the Metro subway train station which was great for Hollywood and downtown and Universal Studios quick access. Our room was shockingly large, decorated nicely, and very clean. The flat screen TV had a zillion HD channels... very nice indeed! The bathroom looked brand new and there were also wooden shutters to further block out light and sound of the city, which was nice for daytime naps. As I said, I like this place and will stay again. Highly recommended and economical (great value to dollar ratio, so to speak in me and my friends' opinion).",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or130-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

The room was very spacious. It had a lot of room to put our stuff away, I usually have issues where tu put all my clothes and other necessities but here the room had a desk with a bench, a table with two chairs, a big shelf and a nightstand on each side of the bed. The room and bathroom were both clean and the towels were changed every day. The room actually looks better than the pictures on the hotels website. We also liked the fact that it had a fridge.  The receptionist was friendly and helpful.    We also liked the location of the hotel, it was across the street of a supermarket, that was opened from 6 a.m. - 2 a.m. and where we went every morning to get some breakfast.    The downsides:  - the Wi-fi is a bit slower than we are used to but it works a bit faster in the mornings;  - the parking lot can get a bit crowded, since it's not a really big one but we always managed to get a free parking space    All in all, we were satisfied with our stay and would go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or130-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

The rooms were big enough for the two of us, pretty standard bar fridge, TV, air con. The bed was ok, except for the discusting blanket on it which made us itchy so we didn't use it. The towels were thin but were changed daily. The free breakfast is tea and coffee making facilities and some light pastries at the reception area, not a sit down meal just something quick to grab on your way out. They have a free car park which is hard to get into because of the narrow drive way and there is about 6 car spots. We had free wifi but the card kept expiring so we had to get a new password almost every day. Our room keys didn't work most of the time so we had to get them replaced almost twice a day but there's always someone at the front desk so that was fine. The front and back door is open 24/7 so anyone off the street can walk in at any time, that might  explain the bullet proof glass at reception. There's a soft drink and ice machine which only accepts $5 bills. Overall we were not looking for 5 star because of our budget and you get what you pay for so I can't say too much more. We won't stay here again, it's worth while spending a little extra and staying closer to Hollywood strip and somewhere with more security.

The room is orderly and leeway with a compartment of space, it's also has a fridge in case you diside to go grocery shopping.

If you yearn to be in the action, go to the east part of the strip, on Expedia where I booked my room, said there was complementary breakfast, I didn't see any, poor advertisement on there part. The fridge had food from the last guest who stayed there.  If you take a cab, it's an hour from here and back to LAX, the fair is around 80 buck's with tip.

However, we realized in the morning that it was not in as bad a location as we thought, however we did have a 7 minute walk or so to the metro which we needed to catch in order to get annywhere pretty much. The room was not impressive. It was big, and we were put in a smoking room despite having asked for non-smoking.

The staff, however, were really friendly and helpful and were always giving us directions. They even helped us figure out how to get to Anaheim. It was a family-run business and they allowed us to leave our bags in their room after we checked out so that we could continue exploring LA. Overall, i think if you're on a budget, this isn't an awful place to stay as long as you insist you get a non-smoking room if you are a non-smoker.

Most hotels in Hollywood have parking but you have to pay and it‚Äôs not on the premises. Entrance to parking lot was very narrow (only 1 car could barely get through) and there were only like 8 spots for the whole hotel. Check in was fast and easy. The room was very large and the internet (free) was fast. Room was very dim yet it had so many light switches scattered in the large room. The counters were very low and I had to keep going on my knees to look in the mirrors (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 which is not that tall). My window had a lovely view of a wall a few inches from the building. The bathroom seemed new and clean but the water temperature was not stable. The TV reception was bad and NBC was completely out during the Olympics! Staff didn‚Äôt have a solution for it. Luckily I had my DVR at home running or else I would have demanded my money back. Around 10:30pm a ‚Äúlady‚Äù was banging at a door demanding her ‚Äúthings‚Äù from someone who refused to open the door. Staff tried to calm her down but she kept hitting the door and shouting crude things. By the looks of her she was a hooker. Staff called security/police to get her out but it took a long time before they were called. Staff also sunk to the woman‚Äôs level by saying profanities which was very unprofessional. The room was very dark which was nice when trying to sleep. In the morning, the parking situation was horrible. People parked in places that were not spots and they blocked me, my boyfriend and others from moving their cars. My boyfriend and I are locals and we had to go to work that morning. Staff was too busy addressing complaining guests to help out with getting our cars out. After 15 mins of careful maneuvering I got my car out and had to lend my car to my boyfriend so he could get to work on time after dropping me off. We had to race back to the hotel to get his car during our lunch (staff was nice enough to allow his car not to be towed during this time).

Another thing that has come up a lot is the noise at the hotel, up until the last week I didn't hear anybody else in the other rooms though one night in that last week there were a few noisy people in the hallway though after about 20 minutes I couldn't hear them again.    Its a pretty good area seen as the metro station around the corner can get you to most places. I would say this hotel is ideal for travellers on a budget, im pretty fussy when it comes to hotels and I actually liked this one. The transport is close by, big rooms, clean rooms. The only problem is the service but you shouldnt really get any problems to ask them about. Oh and breakfast is coffe and a pastry thing so i decided to skip that but my dad seemed to like them. The free wifi is good too and theres free parking at the back",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or150-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jul 2009,10,Scary place,"I stayed in Hollywood Star Inn couple of nights with my friends. I have to say for the first time in my life I was really scared.  When we arrived to the Star Inn, the place looked really dodgy, the doors to the street n backyard were fully open. When we were checking in, a shemale walked in and asked us for money. Every single time we walked in or out both of the doors were open and we didn't see the staff anywhere. So basically anyone can walk in.  The rooms were big but dim. I can't tell were they clean since I couldn't see there properly.  One night a horrible screaming n shouting woke us up. A woman or shemale screamed and their room phone kept ringing. We were awake listening that almost an hour before security came. Soon LAPD arrived and then they started to discuss about the situation in the hallway. I still don't know what was that all about.  That was the most horrible hotel/motel I've ever stayed in. I would never recommend this place for anybody and surprisingly I will never go there again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or150-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jul 2009,10,room got robbed and manager didn't care.,"As mentioned in the title, our room was robbed and the manager didnt care or help at all. Another room also got roobed that day.  Breakfast is a wrapped up/ fat stuffed thing in a bag. coffee is with powdered milk.  This is in a very dodgy area of hollywood and they leave the front and back doors open 24 hours and the receptions is unmanned a lot as they are always out back.  I will never stay here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or150-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jun 2009,20,You get what you pay for,"We were on a budget while in LA so the price suited but on arriving at the hotel we waited to check in behind a couple who had arrived, viewed their room and decided to leave. The hotel is cheap and I have seen worse area's of LA but I did feel quite unsafe while staying there mainly due to some of the dodgy looking guests. The front and back entrace to the hotel/motel are left wide open meaning anyone could walk in if and when they wanted to and the desk isn't manned 24hrs so the rooms are quite exposed. My friend and I ended up putting our suitcases across the door at night when we went to bed for extra security. The room itself was large enough and the cleanliness was okay, my one gripe was the sheet was too small for the bed so you would end up having the bare mattress underneath you during the night which was pretty gross.    One a positive the location of the hotel is not too bad, close to Universal, Hollywood Bowl and so on. It also has a free car park at the back.    I think if you are maybe a guy or a group of males not wanting to spend much then this would be okay for you but I really wouldn't recommend it to females staying on their own or anyone with kids. It just felt too unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Feb 2009,30,"Big Rooms, soso Area, Cleanliness ok","Well, it had been nice there...it had been the biggest room on our whole trip, the cleanliness was good enough... it¬¥s not dirty though, but also you don¬¥t feel like in a very clean and tidy place. Toilet and shower are old, heater is dusty, but no bed bugs, no hairs of someone else...!  The location is pretty close to the Hollywood/Highland Center if you don¬¥t mind to take the metro for 2 stations for only $1.50. Of course you can walk there, if you like to, we did so as well (BUT just ONCE!)  The are where the hotel is located is not the best one, but definetly not the worst. We hadn¬¥t had a weird feeling somewhere around, there are homeless people...like everywhere in the city. So actually it was nice and we liked it, because we didn¬¥t expect too much for what we paid for a room of this size.  The only fact I didn¬¥t like was the guy of the reception... maybe I do him wrong and he had just a few bad days... but he hardly said a word the whole time, nothing to mention about the expression in his face... nothing to feel very welcome.  But anyway, at least it still has been worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Sept 2008,20,Get what you pay for..,"Previous review mentioned a clean bathroom. I tell you its no cleaner than any other place. I had two issues with this place. The first one is big. BED BUGS! Yes I said bed bugs. It was after I woke up early morning and saw it crawling onthe bed. I grabbed some t-paper and squashed it. I freaked out because it was full of blood!! Mine or my wifes I dont know. But it mustve had a nice feast because it left a nice spot on the white sheet. My friend across in room 108 had bed bugs too! The second issue was inconsistently with the housekeeping. They forgot to leave me wash towels twice in a 5 day span. ???also when I did get the wash towel one of them had bits of hair embedded in the towel much like when you get a hair cut and all those lil hairs get in your ear, your shirt and you have to gethome and change clothes and shower cuz it gets itchy. Other than that. The location was close to the attractions which was good but the area was not all that great. I didnt know LA had so many homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

This hotel is in a fairly rough area of Hollywood, but once we got inside we were impressed by the size and cleanliness of the rooms. The hotel has its own parking as well.    It was only a short drive to Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Griffith Observatory, and then we spent the evening in a wonderful dive bar just around the corner (I think it was called the White Horse).

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jan 2008,50,fantastic Hollywood hotel,"I was really nervous about staying in Hollywood proper (single woman travelling alone) and didn't have a lot of time to research hotels. So, I'd say I took a gamble on the Hollywood Star and I'm glad I did!    I'll say that I don't need '4 star' establishments when I travel. I just want something clean, quiet, and well-located. This hotel fit the bill and more.    Specific points worth mentioning:    Parking--I was grateful for free parking near all the major Hollywood landmarks (some would call it a hike, but I like walking). I planned to stay in Hollywood until 4PM the afternoon of the day I checked out and asked the clerk if I could leave my car at the hotel. She just asked me how long and said 'no problem.'    The room--Could have used some sprucing up, but it was clean and I was thrilled to have a refrigerator.    The bathroom--WOW. It had obviously been redone very recently and was absolutely spotless and beautiful. It didn't even seem to fit the style of the hotel. Major points for this.    The location--the Hollywood sights were several blocks away (walking distance for me) so some might not like that. There are tons of fastfood restaurants around the hotel (including a Denny's). I walked back to my hotel one night *after sundown* and felt safe.    If I had to go back to Hollywood, I'd stay here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Aug 2007,20,CLEAN AND SAFE,"The stay in Hollywood Star Inn it is not so bad. The room was large and the bathroom was clean though towels were not enough for two people. Regarding parking when we arrived there were some injured cars in the parking behind the building and we were little afraid to leave the car here, but when we went back in the night the cars were disappear and the parking looks like safe and that's exactly as it was.  We had two little problems. One just arrived with the room, they gave us the keys of two rooms and we could decide what we wanted of the two, but both were not ready although were the 3 PM. The second one with the room's key. The key often became demagnetized so we were forced to go to the reception where there ever was nobody and we had to wait.  The location it is not so bad, you are just three Km from Chinese theater. If you want to visit the Universal Studios and the Warner Bros I suggest this place, obviously you have to get a car. If you want to go to the beach it is not a good place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href

The room was clean overall, exept for the chair had a big stain on it. The bathroom was clean with newer appliances.  However, I had called 2 times to confirm my reservation, but nobody was able to assure my reservations, since I booked it through  [-------]  Anyway , it was important for me that I stayed in a clean and safe place that is resonably priced.

"5435 W Sunset Blvd Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 90027",United States  ,motels, Los Angeles,Hollywood Stars Inn,90027,CA,Jul 2006,20,You get what you pay for,"Let me start by saying that this is not the worst hotel I've stayed in. The location is a little removed from the main attractions. Basically you will see the local population...and not the upper crust, either. It's not the ghetto, it's just not very glamorous.    The first room we were shown had a funny smell. The room we took was quite large and pretty clean, although there was a couch in there that was horribly stained and I really didn't want to know what went on on it. The sheets were clean but didn't quite fit and were not neatly tucked. Considering the size of the room, it was surprising that there was no closet. The bathroom was pretty clean, but the tub could have used a more thorough scrubbing along the bottom and the toilet lid looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in years (but at least the toilet itself was clean). The towels were clean but old and worn (and I wondered whether they could spare more than the 2 they left).    Now, for the good part. The first clue that this place was not for me was the bullet-proof glass covering the front desk and the fact that they wanted to copy my driver's license. Once the motorcycle gangs passed outside, we finally fell asleep only to awaken in the middle of the night by aggressive yelling by a man in the next room followed by the screams of a woman.    We checked out the next morning and went to stay with a friend. Consider that for what it's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g32655-d84499-Reviews-or160-Hollywood_Stars_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html#REVIEWS,redirect_href
